Navigating Generative AI Purchasing Decisions\n\n- With AI adoption being a key imperative for companies, 88% of companies analyzed have an approved budget for AI investments; however, most AI dollars are coming from existing budgets vs net new dollars\n\n- On average, companies allocated 10-15% of their software procurement budget towards GenAI, implying there is additional white space for AI solutions to capture in the future\n\n- The decision makers for GenAI decisions seem to be predominantly CTOs, likely driven by the fact that most AI spend is coming from existing budgets (R&D being the most common source)\n\n- New AI-native vendors might have a difficult road ahead to break into enterprises; when procuring generative AI products, CXOs generally prefer to source from existing vendors, followed by tech incumbents\n\n- CXOs generally prioritize the performance of LLMs above all other factors, with cost being the least important purchasing criterion\n\n## 2. Quantifying Business Value and ROI\n\n- There remain several barriers to adoption in enterprises, including lack of in-house expertise, quality and accuracy, data security / privacy, infrastructure readiness, and the unproven ROI of generative AI\n\n- A key component of AI spend and readiness in enterprises is upskilling and identifying the right resources to enable AI adoption; the majority of AI roles being hired include data scientists, machine learning engineers, and data engineers\n\n- While a large portion of generative AI budgets are still going toward experimental use cases, enterprises have started to see ROI for use cases spanning customer service, IT, software code development, operations, and sales\n\n- Executives expect ROI from generative AI to be in the 5-20% range on average, with productivity gains and cost savings easier to quantify than true revenue impact\n\n## 3.
