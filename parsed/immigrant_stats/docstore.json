A permanent residence permit may be issued when the person has resided in Finland continuously for four years on a continuous residence permit and the conditions for issuing a continuous residence permit are still met. The EU residence permit of a long-term resident from a third country is also considered a permanent residence permit. This requires five years of continuous residence in Finland and it also entitles the holder to stay in another Schengen country for at most 90 days.\n\n## Permanent residence permits issued, 2019-2023\n\n| Year | Permanent residence permit | EU residence permit of a long-term resident from a third country |\n|------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2019 | 10,066                     | 66                                                               |\n| 2020 | 11,388                     | 103                                                              |\n| 2021 | 11,480                     | 83                                                               |\n| 2022 | 11,276                     | 76                                                               |\n| 2023 | 16,116                     | 139                                                              |\n\n## Permanent residence permits issued, grounds, 2023\n\n| Ground                                                        | Positive | Negative | Total |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-------|\n| Permanent residence permit                                    | 15       | 0        | 15    |\n| Family                                                        | 6,753    | 129      | 6,882 |\n| Employment                                                    | 4,376    | 116      | 4,492 |\n| Self-employment                                               | 164      | 29       | 193   |\n| International protection                                      | 3,941    | 227      | 4,168 |\n| Other grounds                                                 | 867      | 40       | 907   |\n| EU residence permit of a long-term resident from a third country | 139      | 24       | 163   |\n| Total                                                         | 16,255   | 565      | 16,820|", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8c75594-7a29-4f8e-babc-a282461f9f3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8c75594-7a29-4f8e-babc-a282461f9f3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_num": 21, "image_path": "C:\\Users\\h02317\\Downloads\\parsed\\immigrant_stats\\images\\ad783a6a-d2de-4f60-844b-f4d7d29ea3ed-img_p20_2.png", "parsed_text_markdown": "# Permanent residence permits issued, top 5 nationalities, 2023\n\n| Nationality | Permits Issued |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| Iraq        | 1,718          |\n| Russia      | 1,577          |\n| Afghanistan | 1,142          |\n| India       | 1,026          |\n| Syria       | 960            |\n\nThe image below the chart shows a group of people, including adults and children, in what appears to be a crowded or confined space.

A large yellow excavator or backhoe in the center of the image. The machine has an extended arm and is positioned over a dug-out area.\n\n2. Three construction workers standing in the foreground, wearing high-visibility safety gear:\n   - Two workers in orange coveralls with reflective stripes\n   - One worker in a yellow high-visibility vest and red pants\n\n3. All three workers are wearing blue hard hats for safety.\n\n4. The workers are standing on sandy or muddy ground, with some gravel visible.\n\n5. There appears to be a dug trench or excavation in front of the workers.\n\n6. One of the workers in orange is holding what looks like a shovel or similar tool.\n\n7. In the background, behind the excavator, there's a glimpse of what appears to be a dump truck or large construction vehicle.\n\n8. The scene suggests ongoing construction or earthwork operations, with the workers likely supervising or preparing for the next phase of work involving the heavy machinery.\n\nThis image illustrates typical construction site activities, emphasizing the use of heavy equipment and the importance of safety gear in such environments.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e28c87d1-9ef3-47a9-aa9b-0df70bd1c859": {"__data__": {"id_": "e28c87d1-9ef3-47a9-aa9b-0df70bd1c859", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_num": 45, "image_path": "C:\\Users\\h02317\\Downloads\\parsed\\immigrant_stats\\images\\ad783a6a-d2de-4f60-844b-f4d7d29ea3ed-img_p38_2.png", "parsed_text_markdown": "# Violations of entry ban\n\nCriminal activity is often the cause for imposing a prohibition of entry (entry ban), which is evident in the group who are violating the prohibition of entry as well.
